type: Claim T4
text: One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society
supporting Claim T4:


attacking Claim T4:
----Premise T5: the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work
----Premise T6: art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning
----Premise T7: If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value
----Premise T8: the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified
