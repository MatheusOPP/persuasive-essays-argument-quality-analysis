Supporting Claim T4

    Premise: Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class
    Premise: While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas
    Premise: This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good
    Premise: I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore
