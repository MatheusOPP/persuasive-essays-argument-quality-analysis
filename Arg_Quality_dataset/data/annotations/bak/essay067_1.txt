    Supporting Claim T9

        Premise: adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents
        Premise: some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc
        Premise: in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide â€“ these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art

    Text: One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society
    Supporting Claim T4


    Attacking Claim T4
        Premise: the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work
        Premise: art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning
        Premise: If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value
        Premise: the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified
