Type: MajorClaim T1
Text: new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal
Supporting MajorClaim T1

    Type: Claim T2
    Text: due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive
    Supporting Claim T2

        Premise: the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming
        Premise: Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford
        Premise: fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas

    No arguments attacks Claim T2

    Type: Claim T8
    Text: these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think
    Supporting Claim T8

        Premise: Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards
        Premise: renewable resources are not as reliable as we think

    Attacking Claim T8
        Premise: utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly


Attacking MajorClaim T1
    Type: Claim T14
    Text: contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming
    Supporting Claim T14


    Attacking Claim T14
        Premise: these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions
        Premise: we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain
        Premise: These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy
        Premise: With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable
