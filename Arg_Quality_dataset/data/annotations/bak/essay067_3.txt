Supporting Claim T4


Attacking Claim T4
    Premise: the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work
    Premise: art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning
    Premise: If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value
    Premise: the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified
