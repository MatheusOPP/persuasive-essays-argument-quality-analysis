type: Claim T16
text: economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside
supporting Claim T16:

----Premise T14: if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away

attacking Claim T16:
----Premise T15: the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now
----Premise T17: It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages
