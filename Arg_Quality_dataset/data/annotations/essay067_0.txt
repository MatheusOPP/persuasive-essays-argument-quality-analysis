type: MajorClaim T1
text: freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create
supporting MajorClaim T1:

----Claim T3: this world needs them to make itself colourful
----type: Claim T9
----text: restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply
----supporting Claim T9:

--------Premise T11: adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents
--------Premise T10: some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc
--------Premise T12: in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art

attacking MajorClaim T1:
----type: Claim T4
----text: One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society
----supporting Claim T4:


----attacking Claim T4:
--------Premise T5: the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work
--------Premise T6: art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning
--------Premise T7: If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value
--------Premise T8: the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified
